The user must provide the following information:

Email address
Password
The user may provide the following information:

Coupon code
The form must be submitted to POST /api/users. If the request was successful it must display a positive message like successful registration and clear the input fields otherwise display the message from the response.

Below the form you must display the username of the 5 latest registered users in an unordered list. The username is the first part of the email address. For example the username for noreply@example.com is noreply.

POST /api/users
This endpoint must handle the incoming registration requests.

The user must not be allowed to register with the same email address more than once
The password must be stored in the database using the ROT13 substitution cipher
The password must only contain letters from the Latin-alphabet
If the coupon code FIRST100 is provided then increase the new user's balance with 1000 units
The coupon code must only work for the first 100 registrants
Example
The request body must contain the information in the following format:

{
  "email": "noreply@example.com",
  "password": "secure",
  "couponCode": "FIRST100"
}
If the registration was successful the response must have 201 Created status code otherwise it must have 400 Bad Request and a descriptive message like email is already in use, invalid coupon code or password must only contain letters from the Latin-alphabet

{
  "message": "email is already in use"
}
GET /api/users
This endpoint must return all the users in the following format:

[
  {
    "email": "noreply@example.com",
    "balance": 0
  },
  {
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
